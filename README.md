🏏 My INTERNSAVY Internship Task 4: Analyzing Cricket Batsmen's Performance with Data Science 📈

As part of my INTERNSAVY internship, I had the exciting opportunity to take on Task 4, which involved exploring and analyzing the performance of cricket batsmen using Data Science techniques. Here's a brief overview of my findings:



📊 Dataset:

For this task, I worked with a real dataset named "Batsman_Data.csv." The dataset provided valuable information on runs scored, balls faced, strike rate, boundaries (4s and 6s), and other relevant metrics for various batsmen.



📈 Data Exploration:

Before diving into the analysis, I carefully examined the dataset to understand its structure and content. This initial exploration helped me gain insights into the available data and paved the way for further investigation.



🔍 Data Cleaning:

To ensure the accuracy of my analysis, I handled missing values in the dataset diligently. I replaced any missing values in the runs, balls faced, strike rate, 4s, and 6s columns with zeros. Additionally, I converted these columns into numeric data types for seamless processing.



📊 Data Visualization:

Visualizations are an excellent way to present insights from data effectively. I utilized the powerful Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create various visualizations:

Histogram,Scatter Plot,Dual, & Bar Plot.



⚙️ Machine Learning - Predicting Runs:

Taking the analysis a step further, I applied Machine Learning techniques to predict a batsman's runs based on features like balls faced, strike rate, 4s, and 6s.

🔧 Data Preprocessing:

To prepare the data for modeling, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. Additionally, I standardized the feature variables using the StandardScaler and imputed any missing values in the target variable (Runs) with the mean.



📈 SVR Model:

For prediction, I opted for a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) with a linear kernel. The model was trained on the training set and used to predict runs on the test set.



🎯 Evaluation Metrics:

To evaluate the model's performance, I utilized Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. These measures provided valuable insights into the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities.


This task allowed me to showcase my skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. By leveraging data-driven insights, I gained a deeper understanding of batsmen's performances in cricket, which could contribute to better strategies and decision-making in the game.



Feel free to explore the code and the findings, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for further analysis!
